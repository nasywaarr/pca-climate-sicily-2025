This repository contains an interactive HTML report of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on climate variables in Sicily. The analysis focuses on identifying key patterns in the data using the first and second principal components.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to explore and visualize the main climate and environmental variability across Sicily, providing insights for sustainable planning, water resource management, and regional development.

## Features
Interactive HTML visualization of the first and second principal components, including
  - Water stress
  - Temperature
  - Precipitation
  - Agriculture
  - Urban areas

## Usage
Open the `pca_analysis_sicily.html` file in any web browser to explore the interactive PCA results.

## Hackathon
This project was developed for **Hack4Future Sicily 2025**.
